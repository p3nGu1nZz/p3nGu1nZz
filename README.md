### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m **p3ngu1nZz**, a passionate gamer and developer with a deep commitment to innovation. Currently, I'm working on **Plasma**, a cutting-edge WebGPU game engine written entirely in pure JavaScript. Plasma pushes the boundaries of performance, rivaling industry titans like Unity and Unreal Engine 5. By employing JIT-WASM compilers, Plasma seamlessly utilizes multiple processors for shaders and game code while efficiently running on separate processes. We're also extending the engine's core to support N-dimensional matrices for tensor calculations, drawing inspiration from frameworks like PyTorch. **Plasma-Arc**, our groundbreaking tech demo, showcases the engineâ€™s remarkable capabilities.

I'm also diving into **Project Tau**, a state-of-the-art Deep Q-Network (DQN) initiative that integrates dual bidirectional LSTMs and Vector State for advanced evolution of Long-Term Memory (LTM). Alongside this, I'm developing **Bad Cat**, a game that has been lovingly crafted over the past four years.

My passion lies in creating fun and immersive gaming experiences, leveraging technologies like Python, C++, and WebAssembly. I thrive on contributing to open-source projects, collaborating with like-minded innovators, and continually expanding my technological horizons. ðŸ˜Š
